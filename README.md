# Turtle Graphics with Python üê¢

This Python script utilizes the `turtle` module to create a simple drawing program where you can control the movement of a turtle using keyboard inputs.

## Instructions

1. Run the script: `python turtle_graphics.py`
2. Use the following keys to control the turtle:
   - Press **'a'** to move forward.
   - Press **'q'** to move up and to the left.
   - Press **'s'** to move backward.
   - Press **'z'** to move down and to the right.
   - Press **'c'** to clear the screen and reset the turtle.

## Functions

- `move_forward()`: Moves the turtle forward by 10 units.
- `move_up()`: Rotates the turtle left by 10 degrees and moves it forward by 10 units.
- `move_backward()`: Moves the turtle backward by 10 units.
- `move_down()`: Rotates the turtle right by 10 degrees and moves it forward by 10 units.
- `clear_screen()`: Clears the screen, lifts the pen, and resets the turtle to its initial position.

- Turtle module (usually included in Python standard library)
